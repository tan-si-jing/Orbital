# Motivation

When you’re preparing an upcoming trip, much time is inevitably spent on planning. It is a chore to many, and often results in toggling between many tabs and different applications, as well as difficulty organising all the research and putting together a neat, customised itinerary. The sheer amount of effort required in planning a trip makes it seem like an insurmountable task and takes out the fun of the adventure itself. This could be especially overwhelming for inexperienced travellers who do not know where to start.

Aside from researching and deciding on places to go, it is also time-consuming for travellers to attempt optimising the travelling route for the trip. On the other hand, without the optimisation of routes, precious time would be wasted on detours when travelling to locations in the wrong order. More often than not travellers are required to switch between many applications, such as online maps for directions, websites for suggestions of nearby places to visit, or a document containing the itinerary. 

We aim to streamline the process by merging all the functionalities into one website, thereby making the planning of trips more efficient and less tedious.

User Stories:
- As an inexperienced traveller who wants to plan for my next trip, I want to be able to spend less time planning and reduce the amount of research required while creating an optimal and organised itinerary that suits my needs.
- As a tourist who is not familiar with the country I am travelling to, I want to be able to optimise the routes so as to maximise my time, as well as receive suggestions of nearby places to go, tailored according to the purpose of my trip.
- As an experienced traveller, I want to have the flexibility to plan my own travels, with the convenience of having both suggestions for nearby places and directions all in one place which I can access on-the-go.
- As a user who is travelling and planning with others, I want to be able to share my itinerary with other users.



# Project Scope

The website allows users to create and share itineraries, including features such as route optimisation, directions and suggestions of locations to organise and optimise the itinerary.

Globetrotter is a fuss-free itinerary planner that does the dirty work of planning for users and is suitable for those inexperienced with planning trips or users who simply do not want to spend so much time planning. Globetrotter allows you the flexibility to be as hands-on as you wish and suggestions are personalised according to users’ activities preferences. Not only does it allow users to organise their itinerary, it also provides a route optimisation tool and directions to reduce the time unnecessarily wasted on travelling. All the features packed into one website reduces the need to access many different applications at the same time, streamlining the process to allow users to spend less time planning and more time enjoying themselves.

What sets us apart? 
- Spreadsheets (Excel or Google Sheets)
While it allows proper organisation of the itinerary, it is less readable when storing more information in each cell. While using a word document could be an alternative, it is linear and less organised. In addition, all these methods do not provide additional features to improve the travel experience such as route optimisation.

- Existing itinerary-building websites
While it is more suitable for creating and organising itineraries as it is more readable, it is similar to using spreadsheets in that they do not have the additional features mentioned above. Also, they do not cater to travellers of different requirements, where some are too rigid and others too unguided.

- Existing route-optimisation websites
It does not provide suggestions of nearby locations that are tailored to users’ activities preferences. It is also unable to store the itinerary to be edited at a different time, changes are lost when the user closes or refreshes the page.



Enter the country, city and date of travel to begin, and organise your trip and slot activities neatly into each column. A handy button in the sidebar will suggest to you nearby attractions, sightseeing, entertainment and shopping facilities. You can edit and add things to do to your trip, and we will suggest the most efficient route to take for travelling around in each specific day to all your selected locations.
